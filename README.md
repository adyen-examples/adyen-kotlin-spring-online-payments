_NOTE: To allow the Adyen Drop-In and Components to load, you have to add `https://*.gitpod.io` as allowed origin for your chosen set of [API Credentials](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/config/api_credentials_new.shtml)_

## Details

This repository includes examples of PCI-compliant UI integrations for online payments with Adyen. Within this demo app, you'll find a simplified version of an e-commerce website, complete with commented code to highlight key features and concepts of Adyen's API. Check out the underlying code to see how you can integrate Adyen to give your shoppers the option to pay with their preferred payment methods, all in a seamless checkout experience.

## Requirements

-   Java 17
-   Kotlin 1.3
-   Network access to maven central

## Installation

1. Clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-kotlin-spring-online-payments.git
```

## Usage

1. Set environment variables for your [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key), [Client Key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/client-side-authentication) - Remember to add `http://localhost:8080` as an origin for client key, and merchant account name:

```shell
export ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
export ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
export ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
export ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
```

On Windows CMD you can use below commands instead

```shell
set ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
set ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
set ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
set ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
```

2. Start the server:

```
./gradlew bootRun
```

3. Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to select an integration type.

## Testing webhooks

Webhooks deliver asynchronous notifications and it is important to test them during the setup of your integration. You can find more information about webhooks in [this detailed blog post](https://www.adyen.com/blog/Integrating-webhooks-notifications-with-Adyen-Checkout).

This sample application provides a simple webhook integration exposed at `/api/webhooks/notifications`. For it to work, you need to:

1. Provide a way for the Adyen platform to reach your running application
2. Add a Standard webhook in your Customer Area

### Making your server reachable

Your endpoint that will consume the incoming webhook must be publicly accessible.

There are typically 3 options:
* deploy on your own cloud provider
* deploy on Gitpod
* expose your localhost with tunneling software (i.e. ngrok)

#### Option 1: cloud deployment
If you deploy on your cloud provider (or your own public server) the webhook URL will be the URL of the server 
```
  https://{cloud-provider}/api/webhooks/notifications
```

#### Option 2: Gitpod
If you use Gitpod the webhook URL will be the host assigned by Gitpod
```
  https://myorg-myrepo-y8ad7pso0w5.ws-eu75.gitpod.io/api/webhooks/notifications
```
**Note:** when starting a new Gitpod workspace the host changes, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area

#### Option 3: localhost via tunneling software
If you use a tunneling service like [ngrok](ngrok) the webhook URL will be the generated URL (ie `https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io`)

```bash
  $ ngrok http 8080
  
  Session Status                online                                                                                           
  Account                       ############                                                                      
  Version                       #########                                                                                          
  Region                        United States (us)                                                                                 
  Forwarding                    http://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080                                       
  Forwarding                    https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080           
```

**Note:** when restarting ngrok a new URL is generated, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area

### Set up a webhook

* In the Customer Area go to Developers -> Webhooks and create a new 'Standard notification' webhook.
* Enter the URL of your application/endpoint (see options [above](#making-your-server-reachable))
* Define username and password for Basic Authentication
* Generate the HMAC Key
* Optionally, in Additional Settings, add the data you want to receive. A good example is 'Payment Account Reference'.
* Make sure the webhook is **Enabled** (therefore it can receive the notifications)

That's it! Every time you perform a new payment, your application will receive a notification from the Adyen platform.

### Making your server reachable

Your application runs on the cloud: this is normally enough (your server accepts incoming requests)

Your application runs on your local machine: you need to use a service like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to "tunnel" the webhook notifications.

Once you have set up ngrok, make sure to add the provided ngrok URL to the list of **Allowed Origins** in the “API Credentials" of your Customer Area.

### Setting up a webhook

* In the “Developers" -> “Webhooks" section create a new ‘Standard notification' webhook.
* In “Additional Settings” section configure (if necessary) the additional data you want to receive (i.e. 'Payment Account Reference’).

That's it! Every time you perform a payment method, your server will receive a notification from Adyen's server.
